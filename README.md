# centralized-config

## Motivation
I have several machines running the same OS. Over time, my configuration evolved and I had a hard time to keep it in sync on all machines. To make matters worse, some machines might require a slightly deviated configuration.
While many have their config in some (D)VCS, the files are still manually copied. This script replaces that processes by setting symlinks.
